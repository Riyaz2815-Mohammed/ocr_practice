# 📄 OCR Practice – LLM-Based Text Extraction using Mistral AI

## 📌 Overview
This project explores **AI-driven text extraction from image-based documents** using the **Mistral AI API**.

Instead of using traditional OCR engines or image-processing libraries, this project focuses on leveraging a **large language model (LLM)** to interpret and extract textual information directly, aligning with modern **GenAI-powered document intelligence workflows**.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Explore LLM-based approaches to image-to-text extraction
- Understand how Generative AI can be used for document intelligence
- Build an API-driven pipeline for text extraction
- Create a foundation for NLP and legal document analysis systems


## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Mistral AI API**
- **HTTP Requests / API calls**


## 🔍 Key Features
- Image-based text extraction using **Mistral AI**
- AI-driven understanding of document content
- Clean and structured textual output
- Lightweight and extensible architecture
- No dependency on traditional OCR engines


## 🧠 How It Works
1. Image data is provided as input to the system
2. The image is sent to **Mistral AI** via API
3. Mistral interprets the image and extracts text
4. Extracted content is returned in structured text form
5. Output can be used for NLP or downstream analysis


🚀 Future Enhancements

Confidence scoring and uncertainty detection

Multi-page and PDF support

Clause-level extraction and semantic analysis

Integration with legal and enterprise workflows
