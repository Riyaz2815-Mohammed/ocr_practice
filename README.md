# 📄 OCR Practice – Document Text Extraction using Mistral OCR

## 📌 Overview
This project explores **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** using **Mistral AI’s OCR capabilities** to extract text from image-based documents.

The focus of this project is to understand how **modern GenAI-powered OCR systems** work and how they can be integrated into document intelligence pipelines for downstream NLP and analysis tasks.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Extract text from images using **Mistral OCR**
- Understand AI-based OCR workflows
- Build an API-driven document processing pipeline
- Create a foundation for NLP and legal document analysis systems



## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**
- **Mistral AI API**
- **HTTP Requests / API calls**


## 🔍 Key Features
- Image-to-text extraction using **Mistral OCR**
- AI-powered interpretation of document content
- Clean and readable text output
- Lightweight, API-driven design
- Suitable for scanned documents and image-based files


## 🧠 How It Works
1. Image-based document is provided as input  
2. The document is sent to **Mistral OCR** via API  
3. Mistral OCR extracts and interprets textual content  
4. Extracted text is returned in structured format  
5. Output can be used for NLP, validation, or analysis  


🚀 Future Enhancements
